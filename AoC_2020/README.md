# Advent of Code 2020

No more exams, woohoo!

Decided to learn Rust, with day1 being my first ever Rust file. There is also a Python folder for those days I don't feel like learning how to do stuff in Rust.


All Rust programs are benchmarked with [Criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs).
